ðŸŒ³ Abundance Token
==================

Money might not grow on trees, but anyone can mint themselves this [Soroban](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20) [Fungible Token](https://soroban.stellar.org/docs/reference/interfaces/token-interface)!

This copies the UI from an [Ethereum Abundance Token](https://github.com/chadoh/abundance-token), connecting it to Soroban instead.

This project uses raw JS rather than React, which will help drive development of less React-enmeshed JS developer libraries for Soroban.
