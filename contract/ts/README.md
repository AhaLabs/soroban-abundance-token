TO BE REMOVED
==============

This directory will be auto-generated by the `make build-ts` command shown in [the Makefile](../Makefile), and will live in the `contract/target` directory, which is gitignored. We are putting it here for now so we can figure out what code to generate.

The `src` and `out` directories will go away; only the built files shown in `out` will remain, flattened into the root.

TODO
----

- [x] allow overriding contract ID and soroban network with environment variables
  - make sure they support the `PUBLIC_*` prefixes required by Astro (and other frontend frameworks?)
- [ ] come up with generated readme that explains these enviroment variables
